# Discord Bot Template

A Discord bot built using **C#** and **.NET**. This template provides a foundation for creating scalable and maintainable bots.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and restore dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   
2. Restore Dependencies
   ```bash
   dotnet restore

3. Update Configuration

   - Open the appsettings.json file and update it with your bot's configuration details:
     - Recommendation: Use User Secrets to store sensitive data like your bot token securely. This is more secure than keeping secrets directly in appsettings.json.


## Notes
Avoid committing sensitive information (e.g., tokens) to version control.
